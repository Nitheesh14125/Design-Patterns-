S - Single responsibility 

What ever the classes that you create should only have a single responsibility 
one class = one job 
* As a class only do one thing and it has only one responsibilty 
* It does not do all the task which are presented each has there individual and similar repsonsibility to be done 


example:- 
AI model: class AI model 
which it should only have the responsibilty of train and predict the model which is an good practise 
which the functions are :
    Train 
    Predict 
but Bad model has 

    save_file 
    load_file 
    which the above two functions are the responsible for the data storing of ai which should not be in the AI model
